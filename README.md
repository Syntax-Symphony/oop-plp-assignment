#  OOP in Python: Smartphone & Vehicle Project

## Description
This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Constructors (`__init__`)**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**

##  Contents

### Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- `Smartphone` class with attributes like brand, model, price, and battery level.
- `Smartwatch` subclass that inherits from `Smartphone` and adds fitness features.
- Demonstrates **encapsulation**, **method overriding**, and **inheritance**.

###  Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- A `Vehicle` base class with a `move()` method.
- Subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` each implement their own version of `move()`.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** in action.
